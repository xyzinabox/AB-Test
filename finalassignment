--Q1
--We are running an experiment at an item-level, which means all users who visit will see the same page, but the layout of different item pages may differ.
--Compare this table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing.
--Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?

--Answer is No. The created_date is needed as it has period of 30-day view

--Q2
--Reformat the final_assignments_qa to look like the final_assignments table, 
--filling in any missing values with a placeholder of the appropriate data type.

Q5
--Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence. 
--For orders_bin: lift is -15% – 11% (-2.2%) and pval is 0.74
--For views_bin: lift is and pval is -2.1% – 5.9% (1.9%) and pval is 0.36
--Therefore for item_test_2, there was no significant difference in either the number of views or the number of orders between control and experiment
